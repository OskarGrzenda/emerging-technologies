# Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks called `quantum-deutsch.ipynb` and `scikit-learn.ipynb` and other relevant files demonstrating my work on the Python packages `pandas`, `numpy` and `qiskit` for the module Emerging Technologies.

## Explore

Have a look at the two notebooks in this repository in Jupyter.

- The notebook `scikit-learn.ipynb` has 3 different algorithims such as classification, regressions and clustering. Each algorithim uses a different data set which displays different types of graphs using the data. You can edit the parameters of the plots to see different effects.  

- The notebook `quantum-deutsch.ipynb` is a notebook that talks about quantum computing, how it works and demonstrates an example of a Deutch's algorithim which is a quantum computing algorithim. It is demonstarted using Qiskit which allows us to draw circuits.

### Sci-kit Learn

Machine learning library for python
This is what I used to demonstarte different algorithims in my `scikit-learn.ipynb` notebook

### Qiskit

Quantum computing package for python
I heavily relied on the Qiskit text book in creating this repository you can find it on [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)
